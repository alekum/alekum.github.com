Перечитываю одну замечательную книгу : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! </a> и нахожу, в который раз уже, параллели с собой. Ввиду того, что испытываю полный burn out - депрессию и все в таком духе, для меня советы вполне актуальны и важны. Самоанализ вполне себе вещь. Но специалист лучше. 

И вот <strong>главная </strong> по мне цитата, таки выгорающим людям, от которых остается пепел:

<blockquote>But when it came time to do some research. I couldn't get to work. I was a little tired; I was not interested; I couldn't do research! ...

And then I thought to myself, "You know, what they think of you is so fantastic, it's impossible to live up to it. You have no responsibility to live up to it!"... 

Then I had another thought; Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn't have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics...

So I get this new attitude ... I'm going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever.
Within a week I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air. ...

I had nothing to do, so I start to figure out the motion of the rotating plate...
And before I knew it (it was a very short time) I was "playing" - working, really - with the same old problem that I loved so much, that I had stopped working on when I went to Los Alamos; my thesis-type problems; all those old-fashioned wonderful things.
It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. ...

There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.</blockquote>

Поэтому начинаем пожалуй "играть". Не заботясь особо о том, какое мнение составлено о нас. Насколько к нам "предъявляют"  и насколько эти "загоны" осаждают нас. Мы не виноваты, что их ожидания такие - это их ошибка, но едва ли наша ответственность. 

<em>Just Playing!</em>
