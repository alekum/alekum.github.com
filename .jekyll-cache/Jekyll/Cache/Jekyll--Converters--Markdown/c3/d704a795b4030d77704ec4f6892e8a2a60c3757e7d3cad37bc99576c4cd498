I"Ã<p>One day I was developing a program to work with a python source code. A kind of analyzer for the static code analysis. I found a library <code>Redbaron</code> and wanted conduct some research to understand its capabilities.<code>No so fast cowboy</code> I wrote a lot of python code in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"><code>Pycharm</code></a> created by the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/"><code>JetBrains</code></a>. After my tests via <a href="http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/"><code>pytest</code></a> Iâ€™ve got the first bug. Iâ€™ve got the same problem like in <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/redbaron/issues/119">#119</a> (Really, Is it a problem of IDE by the JetBrains?).</p>
