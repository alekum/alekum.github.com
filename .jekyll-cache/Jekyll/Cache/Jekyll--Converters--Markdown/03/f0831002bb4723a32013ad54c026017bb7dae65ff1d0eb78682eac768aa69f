I"ã<p>In the previous part, weâ€™ve discussed the problem that was presented in <code class="highlighter-rouge">RedBaron</code>. Today I want to show you my old work, my old little investigation about another strange bug(or feature?) in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Baron</code>. &lt;/br&gt;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Baron</code> is a part of <code class="highlighter-rouge">RedBaron</code> library, literally, <code class="highlighter-rouge">RedBaron</code> relies on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Baron</code> Full Syntax Tree which itâ€™s giving for next manipulations.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Baron</code> had a problem with CommentNodeâ€™s position in the FST tree.
This bug broke RedBaronâ€™s nodes recognition.</p>
